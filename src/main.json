			"My name is Iris Ng, and I'd like to welcome you to my website! I'm a student currently in my 4th year of Software Engineering and Management at McMaster University. Software Engineering and Management is a 5 year program in which I am given the opportunity to take several core Commerce courses to understand the business and managerial aspect of engineering.",
			"Currently, I'm learning more about back-end systems in web applications so I have knowledge on the full spectrum of web development. Because I'm proficient with AngularJS, I'm reading up on the MEAN stack to expand my skills so that I can become a full-stack engineer."
