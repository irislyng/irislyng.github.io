			"My name is Iris Ng, and I'd like to welcome you to my website! I'm a student currently in my 4th year of Software Engineering and Management at McMaster University. Software Engineering and Management is a 5 year program in which I am able to take several core Commerce courses to understand the business and managerial aspect of engineering.",
			"Currently, I'm learning about back-end systems in web applications so I have knowledge on the full spectrum of web development. I'm most comfortable using AngularJS, so I'm reading up on the MEAN stack to expand my technical skills in order to become a full-stack engineer."
